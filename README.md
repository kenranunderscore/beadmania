# beadmania

The purpose of this program is to convert (and possibly resize) images to a
fixed set of colors. This will be done using color spaces and respective
algorithms. Since these are made to emulate the perception of the human eye,
the results are much better than when, for instance, just taking the Euclidean
distance between two RGB values - which most other programs seem to do.

The application is specially tailored for people who like to create "bead art",
that is, using beads (Perler, Nabbi, Hama, and so on). I plan to include
default sets of colors to target these manufacturers, but also to implement
a possibility to create custom color sets.
